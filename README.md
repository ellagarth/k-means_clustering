# k-means_clustering
Python code for k-means clustering for a basic dataset

1) Use dataset.py to create a fake dataset called fake_student_dataset.csv.
2) Use clustering.py to import fake_student_dataset.csv and run the clustering, and play with the options at the top of the code.
Results will automatically be visualised as a scatterplot, and output will be saved numerically as student_clusters_with_options.csv
